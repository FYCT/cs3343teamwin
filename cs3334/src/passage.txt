A source from the authority said it planned to standardise its misconduct investigations, and after a probe had been completed it would be up to the hospital involved to suggest to patients or their relatives whether the case would be referred to the council.
Under the change, a probe is likely to be led by at least three parties - an administrative staff member assigned by the authority, a staff member from the hospital where the suspected misconduct took place, and a frontline practitioner.
Medical Council chairman Professor Joseph Lau Wan-yee said last month the authority was referring so few cases he feared misconduct was being swept under the carpet.
A California attorney is facing license suspension for alleged deceptive advertising by photoshopping herself into cozy pictures with politicians and celebrities on her official website.
The California State Bar Court is recommending Svitlana Sangary be suspended from practicing law for six months, after an investigation showed her website featured fake publicity photos of her next to President Barack Obama, former President Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Arnold Schwarzenegger, George Clooney, Kim Kardashian, Ellen DeGeneres and others.
The California Bar Association says Sangary's suspension does not go into effect until approved by the California Supreme Court and is recommending two-and-a-half years of probation after the six-month suspension.
On Friday, CNN contacted Sangary windscreen for comment, and she said she would call back shortly. "I will tell you much more later," she said. Later in the day, she declined additional immediate comment.
